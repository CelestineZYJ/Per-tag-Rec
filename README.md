# Personalized-Hashtag-Recommendation

02-CIKM-address the hashtag long-tail phenomenon by constructing a hashtag graph with external knowledge and integrating a propagation mechanism to exploit hashtag correlations.

03-CCL-combine both content and hashtag information from historical posts

04-information-combine both content and hashtag information from historical posts

05-AAAI-For the content modeling module, we adopt the parallel co-attention mechanism to coherently model both image and text as well as the interaction between them; for the habit modeling module, we introduce an external memory unit to characterize the historical tagging habit of each user

07-ECIR-formulate the tag prediction model as a function of the content and the user information图模型表示user-tag

08-DASFAA-transform tag recommendation into a word-based text generation problem and introduce a sequence-to-sequence model

09－IJCAI-An Efficient and Resource-Aware Hashtag Recommendation Using Deep Neural Networks

10－ISCE－Semantically enhanced tag recommendation for software CQAs via deep learning

11-IJCAI-devise an embedding model, called Hashtag2Vec, which exploits multiple relations of hashtag-hashtag, hashtag-tweet, tweet-word, and word-word relations based on the hierarchical heterogeneous network

13－journal－devise an embedding model, called Hashtag2Vec, which exploits multiple relations of hashtag-hashtag, hashtag-tweet, tweet-word, and word-word relations based on the hierarchical heterogeneous network

15－QiZhang－propose a novel method that extends the translation based model and incorporates the temporal and personal factors. To overcome the limitation of only being able to recommend hashtags that exist in the training data of the existing methods, the proposed method also incorporates extraction strategies into it.

16－Future Generation Computer Systems－With users represented by user-topics distribution, the proposed approach finds top-k similar users, then computes all hashtags’ frequencies appeared in these users, and finally the most relevant hashtags are recommended to user. In order to excavate latent topical information, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based topic model is also proposed
